## Developer Note

Please follow [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

To build on Windows, you need to download and build the Program Options library and Log library of [Boost 1.67.0](https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.67.0/source/) in advanced. Either copy the Boost libraries to the lib/win subdirectory of the gplus project or define the BOOST_1_67_0_LIB_DIR environment variable pointing to the directory path of the Boost libraries built on your machine (such as D:\boost_1_67_0\stage\lib).
